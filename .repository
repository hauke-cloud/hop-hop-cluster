title: HOP HOP Cluster
description: |
  This repository contains a collection of scripts to prepare a Fedora CoreOS for a Kubernetes installation and to join or initialize a cluster.

  We are trying to achive following goals with this template:
  - Standardization of Kubernetes cluster creation
  - Configuration using Ignition/Cloud-Init
  - Rolling updates of nodes after cluster initialization
  - Providing the scripts using rpm so that they can be installed in Fedora CoreOS
  - Cluster state determination based on API request and Kubernetes API server
